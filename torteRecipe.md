# Smetna torte recipe

*Maybe* smet***ana*** torte.

Layered squares of shortbread and sour cream/walnut filling. Solid, rich.

Although it can be eaten immediately after assembly, smetna torte should be refrigerated for a day. This changes the texture and makes it easy to cut into pieces, which should be cut into an inch or inch-and-a-half square.   
Smetna torte freezes well.

## Short bread layers

>1/2 pound butter  
 2 cups flour  
 1 egg  
 3/4 cup sugar  
 1 tsp baking powder  

1. Cream butter, add sugar, add egg. Beat well.
2. Add flour and baking powder.
3. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
4. Spread batter evenly over sheet.  
5. Bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes until very **lightly** browned.
6. Turn out. Peel off paper and cut into 3 *equal* sections. 

## Filling

Combine the following:
  
>1/2 pint sour cream  
1/2 cup icing sugar  
1 cup chopped walnuts  
1 tsp vanilla  

## Assembly and presentation##

1. Spread half of the filling on the bottom shortbread, top with shortbread. Spread the remaining filling and then top with the final shortbread.  
2. Wrap in wax paper and chill over night.
3. Cut into 1 inch squares.   

### Tip:
Make the squares attractive: Serve them in pastel colored cupcake wrappers.
